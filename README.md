# Largest letter algorithm for Qooper

This repo includes a solution to the problem below.

**You can adjust values from `src/index.ts` and see the result on the console.**

**Problem**

We are given a string S consisting of N letters. We want to find the alphabetically largest letter that occurs in both lowercase and uppercase in S, or decide that there is no such
letter.

_Note: One letter is alphabetically larger than another if it occurs later in English
alphabetically order. For example, "E" is alphabetically larger than "B"._

**Constraints**

* N is an integer within the range [1..200,000];
* string S consists only of letters (a-z and/or A-Z).
